Project Requirements:

## Create a profile UI that displays three pieces of information from the following of your own choosing:
Basic user identification
XP amount
grades
audits
skills

-- Next to the sections you must have section for a generation of statistic graphs
-- The graphs have to be designed using SVG, you also need at least 2 different statistic graphs for the data given

Possible Combinations, plus ideas:

1) XP earned in a time period (progress over time):

Show how much XP (experience points) you have earned over a certain time frame.

Example: A line graph or bar chart showing XP growth per week or month.

2) XP earned by project:

Display how much XP you gained from specific projects.

Example: A bar chart where each bar represents a project and its corresponding XP.

3) Audit ratio:

Visualize the ratio of audits completed successfully versus audits failed.

Example: A pie chart or donut chart showing successful vs. failed audits.

4) Projects PASS and FAIL ratio:

Show the number of projects you passed versus the ones you failed.

Example: A pie chart or bar chart comparing "PASS" and "FAIL" counts.

5) Piscine (JS/Go) stats:

Highlight statistics related to your performance in the Piscine training for JavaScript or Go.

Example: Completion rates, attempts, or scores in different Piscine exercises.

6) PASS and FAIL ratio:

Similar to projects, but applied more broadly to exercises or tasks beyond just projects.

Example: A chart that aggregates pass/fail data for all tasks.

7) Attempts for each exercise:

Show how many attempts you made for individual exercises.

Example: A bar chart with exercises on the x-axis and the number of attempts on the y-axis.
