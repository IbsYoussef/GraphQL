# GraphQL

## Project Description

**GraphQL** is a student profile dashboard that fetches and visualises coding progress from the **O1 Founders** platform using the GraphQL query language. The main objective of the project is to build a sleek, responsive profile UI 🌐 that presents data to authenticated users of the **01 edu** platform. The data includes:

- ✅ **Audit ratio**
- 🧠 **Top skill categories**
- 📈 **XP progression over time**

As part of this project, you will learn how to:

- Use **GraphQL** to query structured data from an endpoint
- Securely interact with APIs using **JWT tokens**
- Handle and render dynamic data through **SVG-based charts**

This project also places strong emphasis on **frontend design**, incorporating a **dark grey and purple UI theme** that reflects the coding school’s branding. It offers a real-world learning experience in integrating data, logic, and design—equipping you with practical skills in modern web development.
